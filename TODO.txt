- Convert Unit tests to DrupalUnitTestBase (note that this will not be that easy
  as it inherits from PathatutoTestHelper which provides assert functions used).

- transliteration_get() => Drupal::service('transliteration')->transliterate(), remove module exists
  Add a test

- INSTALL.txt: Update
- Settings forms: implement submitForm()

- Update hook_help(): https://drupal.org/node/2250345

Later:
- Move functions that do sql to alias storage sub-class/service?

- pathauto_path_alias_types() => Plugins

- Bulk generation of aliases is without batch implementation, only dummy form is
  displayed

- For the bulk update we need to provide different action to update node and
  user as the action is tied to an entity type. Currently only the action for
  node entities is implemented.

- There is no storage for pathauto checkbox. So if user unchecks the box it will
  be rechecked again on next edit.

- Localization seems not to work. Tests are runnable but not passing.

- The logic that deals with automated aliases spawns across three files
  (pathauto.module, pathauto.inc, PathautoManager.php). It probably makes sense
  to refactor this and put everything inside the manager class. What is
  currently nonsense is the need to include the pathauto.inc file if you want to
  use the manager.

- Lot of legacy stuff in admin.inc that has not be reviewed and migrated if not
  yet done so

- Token tests completely broken

- PathautoUnitTest tests are totally broken as well.

- Not really about pathauto, but the AliasManager probably has a bug that
  affects us: https://drupal.org/node/2281167
