- Convert Unit tests to DrupalUnitTestBase (note that this will not be that easy
  as it inherits from PathatutoTestHelper which provides assert functions used).

- Move functions that do sql to alias storage sub-class/service?

- pathauto_path_alias_types() => Plugins

- Bulk generation of aliases is without batch implementation, only dummy form is
  displayed

- There is no storage for pathauto checkbox. So if user unchecks the box it will
  be rechecked again on next edit.

- The logic that deals with automated aliases spawns across three files
  (pathauto.module, pathauto.inc, PathautoManager.php). It probably makes sense
  to refactor this and put everything inside the manager class. What is
  currently nonsense is the need to include the pathauto.inc file if you want to
  use the manager.

- Lot of legacy stuff in admin.inc that has not be reviewed and migrated if not
  yet done so

- Token tests completely broken

- Not really about pathauto, but the AliasManager probably has a bug that
  affects us: https://drupal.org/node/2281167

- INSTALL.txt: Update

- Update hook_help(): https://drupal.org/node/2250345
