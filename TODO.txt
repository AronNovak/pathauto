- Creating a new node with a manually set alias and not unchecking
  the checkbox results in two aliases, one saved by pathauto and one by
  PathItem. A possible clean way to do this might be to replace the PathItem
  class with a ustom one and completely replace the logic there. Or fix core to
  make sure that it sets ->pid after saving a new alias.

- Move functions that do sql to alias storage sub-class/service?

- User currently does not have a path field, either fix the core issue or
  add it in pathauto. See https://drupal.org/node/476294

- pathauto_path_alias_types() => Plugins

- Bulk generation of aliases is without batch implementation, only dummy form is
  displayed

- There is no storage for pathauto checkbox. So if user unchecks the box it will
  be rechecked again on next edit.
  @berdir: This is AFAIK supposed to be handled based on the current alias.
    If it does not match, then the checkbox is unchecked.

- The logic that deals with automated aliases spawns across three files
  (pathauto.module, pathauto.inc, PathautoManager.php). It probably makes sense
  to refactor this and put everything inside the manager class. What is
  currently nonsense is the need to include the pathauto.inc file if you want to
  use the manager.
  @berdir: As defined above, functions that execute SQL should be moved into
    and extended alias storage service.

- Lot of legacy stuff in admin.inc that has not be reviewed and migrated if not
  yet done so
  @berdir: Patterns and settings forms can be safely removed now I think, the
    other functions once implemented.

- Not really about pathauto, but the AliasManager probably has a bug that
  affects us: https://drupal.org/node/2281167
