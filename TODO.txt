- Convert Unit tests to DrupalUnitTestBase

- transliteration_get() => Drupal::service('transliteration')->transliterate(), remove module exists
  Add a test

- INSTALL.txt: Update
- Settings forms: implement submitForm()

- Update hook_help(): https://drupal.org/node/2250345

Later:
- Move functions that do sql to alias storage sub-class/service?
- pathauto_path_alias_types() => Plugins

- For the bulk update we need to provide different action to update node and
  user as the action is tied to an entity type.

- Fix "Pathauto basic tests"
  Current status:
  - there are some strange fails with path[0][pathauto]
  - bulk operations need to be done
  - AliasManager has some issues with Drupal\Core\Path\AliasManager->cacheClear('node/2')
  - Some stuff from token: Argument 2 passed to Drupal\Core\Form\FormBuilder::setError() must be of the type array, string given, called in /Users/martin/projects/d8.dev/www/modules/token/token.module on line 656 and defined

- Lot of legacy stuff in admin.inc that has not bee fully migrated
