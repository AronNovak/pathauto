- Creating a new node with a manually set alias and not unchecking
  the checkbox results in two aliases, one saved by pathauto and one by
  PathItem. A possible clean way to do this might be to replace the PathItem
  class with a ustom one and completely replace the logic there. Or fix core to
  make sure that it sets ->pid after saving a new alias.

- Move functions that do sql to alias storage sub-class/service?

- User currently does not have a path field, either fix the core issue or
  add it in pathauto. See https://drupal.org/node/476294

- pathauto_path_alias_types() => Plugins

- The logic that deals with automated aliases spawns across three files
  (pathauto.module, pathauto.inc, PathautoManager.php). It probably makes sense
  to refactor this and put everything inside the manager class. What is
  currently nonsense is the need to include the pathauto.inc file if you want to
  use the manager.
  @berdir: As defined above, functions that execute SQL should be moved into
    and extended alias storage service.

- Not really about pathauto, but the AliasManager probably has a bug that
  affects us: https://drupal.org/node/2281167
